# JavaStudy
This is about Java Basic
## Abstract
Here is two objects Circle,Rect
If Circle,Rect has same property make [Shape](https://github.com/DevJIYUL/JavaStudy/blob/main/src/com/abst/Shape.java) abstract class and define method only
concrete content will depend on class

Define abstract class
```
public abstract class Shape
```
Make class [Circle](https://github.com/DevJIYUL/JavaStudy/blob/main/src/com/abst/Circle.java),[Rect](https://github.com/DevJIYUL/JavaStudy/blob/main/src/com/abst/Rect.java) extends Shape
Add override method and concrete method

[ShapeUser](https://github.com/DevJIYUL/JavaStudy/blob/main/src/com/abst/ShapeUser.java) class can call Circle,Rect as Shape object
